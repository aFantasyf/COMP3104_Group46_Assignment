George Brown College is the college that I am currently attending. I enjoy learning about code and
appreciate the help from my professors. My favorite thing to do at George Brown is go to class.
I also want to talk about how I don't like the food choices at george brown.
I wish there was a nice coffee shop in George Brown like how some universities have. The Casa Loma 
campus feels empty and lonely.

The other campuses have better food options and lounge areas. I wonder if this one will ever 
get an upgrade.
