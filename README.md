## Project Description
This assignment 1 makes it so you have to collaborate with your classmates to strategize branching,
CI/CD integration, updating and committing files. Each person has a set of tasks to do, we all had to create 3 files, and complete 10 commits each team member.
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch to your branch using `git checkout STUDENTID-Name`.
3. Install any dependencies as listed.
4. Add your files.
5. Commit your files with an appropriate message.
6. Push to the appropriate branch.
7. Check to see on GitHub that all information is there. 
## CI/CD Pipeline
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is defined
in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
Automating our CI/CD Pipeline is beneficial to us because we are able to 
create better code, with more security and faster.
You are able to do the steps of CI/CD yourself, however CI/CD pipieline
is best when automated. 
## Branching Strategy
Everyone in the group must have their own branch named after their 
student id and name with a dash. Then after that all the chages are merged into the `main` branch 
using the Pull Requests.
Each of us worked together to merge after we created our commits. 
We each pulled and merged through GitHub and made sure that our branches have 
merged succesfully.
